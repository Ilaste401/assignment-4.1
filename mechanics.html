	<h2>Outlaws of Thunder Junction</h2>
	<p>With the newest set of Magic: The Gathering right around the corner, there are naturally quite a number of new mechanics and keywords that are being introduced. Each will be briefly touched upon below, alongside recommended uses and cards to go along with them. Each will similarly link back to the MTG wiki, to make reading up on such a bit easier.</p>
	
	<!--Crimes & Committing Crimes-->
	<section>
	<h3><a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Committing_a_crime">Crimes</a></h3>
	<p>Crimes, and the committing thereof is perhaps one of the most anticipated mechanics in the entire set. Generally, most anything that directly interacts with your opponent's side of the board - from targeting them, targeting their creatures, their graveyard - is a crime. Given the setting for this set, Committing Crimes is usually a good thing, instead of something negative.</p>
	
	<aside>
	<img src="otj-223-oko-the-ringleader.jpg" alt="Thunder Junction Oko" width="300" height="400">
	</aside>
	
	<p>Taking a look at the newest Oko, as shown, his +1 ability related around Crimes actively benefits the user, by allowing them to discard one less card. In some situations such could be useful, but given his color identity of Blue and Green, this isn't necessarily going to be the case.</p>
	</section>
	
	<!--Plotting-->
	<section>
	<h3><a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Plot">Plot</a></h3>
	<p>Another anticipated mechanic, Plot is one that sacrifices time for the ability to play cards at a cheaper value. When Plotting a card, you are able to exile that card for a cheaper mana cost than it normally has associated with it, to play it during a later turn at no cost. While this can certainly prove useful, both as a form of temporary removal and assurance that a card can be played while out of mana, it interacts a bit strangely on creatures. Given without Haste, creatures are forced to deal with Summoning Sickness, it means you'll be down a minimum of two turns upon playing that creature. It'll take a lot of consideration on whether or not certain creatures will be worth such a cost.</p>
	
	<aside>
	<img src="aloe-alchemist.png" alt="Aloe Alchemist" width="300" height="400">
	</aside>
	
	<p>With Aloe Alchemist as the example for Plot, this card proves to be quite useful when plotted. By spending its standard mana cost instead of something cheaper, you can actively grant a fairly strong buff to a creature of your choice, allowing it to swing for a fair amount of damage only to later recur Aloe Alchemist down the line. While it won't be for a while that Aloe sees the field, his abilities more than make up for that.</p>
	</section>
	
	<!--Saddle Mechanics-->
	<section>
	<h3><a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Saddle">Saddle</a></h3>
	<p>Reminiscent of Vehicles from previous sets, Saddle is a keyword on creatures that functions almost identically. Requiring you to tap a number of creatures with combined power equal to or greater than the Saddle value to gain great effect in the process. Much like Vehicles of the past, the effects that are granted from saddled creatures are quite strong, given the cost to utilize them can be quite high in some circumstances.</p>
	
	<aside>
	<img src="otj-36-trained-arynx.jpg" alt="Trained Arynx" width="300" height="400">
	</aside>
	
	<p>Our example for Saddle is Trained Arynx. On its own, a two-mana 3/1 is fairly good value on its own. Being able to tap a two-power creature in order to gain First Strike and Scry 1, however? Assuming you can continually tap for Saddle, this grants Trained Arynx absolutely phenomenal value for its cost.</p>
	</section>
	
	<!--Spree!-->
	<section>
	<h3><a href="https://mtg.fandom.com/wiki/Spree">Spree</a></h3>
	<p>Lastly, we've got Spree. A keyword that more codifies some of the older cards we've seen, Spree allows for cards to have a multitude of effects, each at different costs. Occasionally, some allow for multiple costs to be paid at once to reap all the listed effects. Such an effect allows a card to be useful over the course of an entire game, as opposed to just in the beginning or end.</p>
	
	<aside>
	<img src="otj-61-phantom-interference.jpg" alt="Phantom Interference" width="300" height="400">
	</aside>
	
	<p>Taking a look at Phantom Interference, it serves as not only a solid counterspell, rivaling Negate in terms of cost with ease, but also granting quite noticeable token generation on top of this. Both effects are viable over the course of an entire game, and even more so when able to be cast together with one another.</p>
